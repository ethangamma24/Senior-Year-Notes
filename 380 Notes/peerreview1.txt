ADD Video
 - Used all archive footage
 - Did a good job of using very short, blurry clips to convey the
   sense of inattention and dissociation.
 - Transformed the footage, which was likely just created to be used for the
   background of something like a documentary or informative video.

Gay rights video
 - Used all archive footage
 - Contrasted the video and audio well in order to make the comments speaking
   against gay rights crazy and ridiculous.
