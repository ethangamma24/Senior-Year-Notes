Fix alphabet (sigma). A string (over (sigma)) is a finite sequence of
symbols drawn from (sigma). Let (sigma)* be the set of all strings over
(sigma). if x,y,z E (sigma)* |x| denotes the length of x.
- xy: concatenation of x & y.

- Concatenation is associative.
  ~ (xy)z = x(yz) = xyz
  ~ x = abc, y = da, z = c
    * xyz = abcdac

- (epsilon) denotes the string of length 0, called the empty string.
  ~ NOT IN THE ALPHABET, NOT IN (sigma).
  ~ x(epsilon) = (epsilon)x = x
  ~ So, (epsilomn) is the identity under concatenation.

- Definition: A *language* (over (sigma)) is any arbitrary subset of (sigma)*
	      i.e.: any subset of strings over (sigma).
  ~ Let L be a language L c (sigma)*.
  ~ Can think of L as a decision problem: "Given a string x as input,
    is x in L?" Conversely, L is the set of input strings for which the
    answer is "yes".

- (sigma)* = {0,1} : binary alphabet.
  ~ x E {0,1}* is a binary string.
  ~ Let L = {x E (sigma)* : x ends with 0}
    * Corresponding decision problem: "Given a binary string x, does x end
      with 0?"
  ~ SEE STATE DIAGRAMS IN TEXTBOOK OR ONLINE
  ~ L2 = {x E (sigma)* : x starts with 0}
    * Beginning state points to an accepting state if it is 0, and
      a second rejecting state if it is 1. Both states have self-edges
      with 0,1.
    * States with no outgoing edges to other states are called
      "dead states".
  ~ Initial state must always be rejecting because of (epsilon).
  
- Let A be an "automaton". Let x be a string. Say that A accepts x if
  reading x from the start state of A lands in an accepting state.
  Otherwise, A rejects x.
- Define L(A) := {x E (sigma) : A accepts x} (language recognized by A)

- Ex:
  ~ (sigma) = {a,b,c}
  ~ L4 := {x E (sigma)* : x has an a follwed by a b, followed by a c 
           somewhere, not necessarily continuously.}

- Definition: A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is a 5-tuple
  	      (Q,(sigma),(delta), q0, F) where Q is a finite set,
	      (sigma) is an alphabet, q0 E Q (the start state),
	      F c Q (states in F are accepting states),
	      (delta) : Q x (sigma) --> Q
  ~ Elements of Q are states.
